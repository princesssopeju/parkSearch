## How it works

**Search Functionality:** Users can enter their location or allow the application to detect it automatically. The app then uses the Google Maps Geocoding API to convert the location into geographic coordinates.
**Park Recommendations:** The coordinates are sent to the Google Maps Places API, which returns a list of nearby parks. The app processes this data and displays it to the user, including park names, addresses, ratings, and photos.
**Mobile and Desktop Compatibility:** The responsive design ensures that the application is fully functional and visually appealing on both desktop and mobile devices.
